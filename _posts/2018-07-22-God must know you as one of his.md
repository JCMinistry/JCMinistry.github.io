*Isa 5:13*

God is concerned with a generation that knows him. God is speaking to us this morning that we have gone into captivity because we lack knowledge, knowledge of knowing him. In the Bible, "my people" has been highlighted more than a hundred and twenty times. It is a sad reality that there are some people who God does not recognize as his people. It is sad to be in church and not have the knowledge of God. 

Our honorable men have gone to vanish.,the church is quiet because she has lacked her knowledge of what God wants.
May our names be registered in heaven as one of his. We have gone into captivity because we don't know who blesses us, who protects us. Although God created all people, not all people are God's people.
How do we enter into captivity?

- Thought patterns- as a person thinketh, so he is. The way we think can let us into captivity. The thought s of defeat, witchcraft, fear, and failures. It locks us out of God's presence. To change our thinking pattern takes real struggle.
- When we think more about ourselves,and less about God.
- if you are thinking more about yourself in giving, going to fellowship, work and less about God, then you are in captivity. We live in a generation where Christians are so centered in themselves, what they will get after prayers, what will come to them in person when the come to fellowship. They complain so much about so little things. It extends to preachers that will talk about their cars, the houses they live in,the price of the suits they wear. 
- The state of not knowing God keeps us away from God. The fact that we are found in church does not guarantee us to be a people of God. 

God must know us as one of his. He wants us to be one of his.The church is going into captivity,not caring what happens to the state of governance, when the constitution is being tampered with to displace the position of God, when the national anthem is being deviated from addressing God with a prayer....may our nation be built by God, let our church be known for knowing who God is.

God knew David even before the king knew him. Most of us struggle so much to be known by men, recognition from the political class, and not God. A lot of us are trapped in speaking ill of other people because we fail to concentrate on our assignment here on earth. Let us be the best on what we are assigned, fixing our eyes on Jesus, knowing who we are in God. May we be delivered from the mentality of thinking that our knowledge of people will change our lives. 

How do you become a person of God?

- Love Agape love, Jn 13:34-35. Be a person that loves, let's embrace and celebrate one another. Love brings multiplication.,it keeps no record of evil. It does not boast.

- Be people of a purpose- God identifies with a people of purpose, United, moving towards one goal. People of a purpose don't quarrel,they hold a purpose together and work best in all they do.
- Be a person of character- our God has character, he is holy, he is kind, he is faithful, he is a giver. Phil 1:27. The real you is when you are all alone,where no one knows or sees you.
- Have hope- Rom 12:12, be joyful in Hope, be a person that is full of hope of better days ahead. It is not over until God says so. 
- Consecrate yourself to God,- be led by the holy spirit, give yourself to God.Set yourself a part for God. 
Take God seriously
