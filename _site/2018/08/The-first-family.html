<i>Gen 4:1-8</i>
<i>Lk 10:1</i>
</p>
<p>
    God is always interested in a family. God created a good family and had a plan that he was going to show his prosperity through this family,that he was going to rule over the world through this family.
    When a family decides to honour and remain with God, they experience favour and prosperity. May God use us to be his representatives in our families. God is annointing us to be rebuilders of the bridge of our families to our God. Let's be a people that God is counting on us. God has a lot of interest in our siblings, parents and family members. When we weep because of our families, God also weeps. May God help us to be the priests in our families.
</p>
<p>
    Sometimes we make or say things that destroys the bridge between God and our families, that a time comes when God wants to bless our families but he finds hate, conflicts and violence in us.
    As the children were killing one another,Adam and Eve knew very well what the issue was. Abel and Cain killed themselves without knowing what caused the trouble, but Adam and Eve knew where their recklessness began.
    They spent their time in pleasure and the results were their children living with hate for one another. It is usually good to check what is going on with our families,and praying with them for their mistakes. God had mercy with Abraham and Eve,and blesses them with Seth.
</p>
<p>
    May God open another door to replace that which was destroyed because of our family faults. May every bridge that was broken in our families be rebuilt in Jesus name. God can raise us for others in our families. In our families,there is a certain seed that carries the annointing to destroy what the devil has done in our family. We cannot be any better without God ,without him we are nothing. Because of Enosh, men began to call one the name of the Lord.
</p>
<p>
    Grace and peace be multiplied unto you. He appeared in the flesh, was vindicated by the spirit, was seen by the angels, was preached among the nations,was believed in the world, was taken up in glory.
